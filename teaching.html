            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>My teaching philosophy centers on fostering a dynamic and inclusive learning environment that encourages critical thinking and interdisciplinary inquiry. I view language as both a structured system and a cultural phenomenon, emphasizing how linguistics and Egyptology intersect in exploring ancient societies.</p>

            <p>By connecting linguistic theory with archaeological and socio-historical contexts, I aim to make complex topics accessible and engaging for diverse audiences. In my courses, seminars, and workshops, students analyze primary sources and explore how languages and arcaheological evidece can be used and combined to understand the past, developing independent research skills and intellectual curiosity.</p>

            <h3>Teaching Areas and Experiences</h3>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have taught across a wide range of topics within Egyptology, Linguistics, and Near Eastern Studies, from language classes, advanced linguistic courses and seminar, and introductory courses on the history of Egypt and the Near East, with a focus on identity, diplomacy, imperialism, and cultural interactions.</p>

            <p>I have also been invited to teach at international programs such as the **Leiden University Summer School** in Linguistics, where I collaborated with experts in Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic to provide introductions to Egyptian and Afro-Asiatic linguistics. This setting allowed me to blend historical linguistics and sociolinguistics with broader cultural insights, enriching the students’ understanding of languages as living historical record.</p>

            <p>My teaching extends to computational methods as well. I led an intensive workshop on Python for linguistics for doctoral students at the University of Basel, equipping participants with practical computational tools for linguistic data analysis. This hands-on approach reflects my commitment to integrating digital tools into historical linguistics, ensuring students are prepared for modern research challenges.</p>
            
            <p>Through these diverse formats, from university courses and international seminars to intensive workshops, I continually aim to create an inclusive and engaging educational experience, empowering students to approach the human past from multiple, complementary dimensions.</p>
