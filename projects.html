            <h2>Projects and Collaborations</h2>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have engaged in multiple interdisciplinary projects and collaborations that bridge Egyptology, history, archaeology, linguistics, and historical sociolinguistics. Below are some of the ongoing projects, collaborative networks, and tools development efforts I’m involved in.</p>

            <h3>Ongoing Projects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LCDE: Like the conversation of a Delta man with a man from Elephantine! Exploring the interactions between dialectal realities, Levantine loanwords, and sociolinguistic dynamics in New Kingdom Egyptian</strong>  
                    <p><a href="https://daw.philhist.unibas.ch/de/aegyptologie/forschung/forschungsprojekte/lcde/" target="_blank">Supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation</a>, this project examines dialectal variation in New Kingdom Egyptian through linguistic, archaeological, and social lenses. By focusing dialectal differences, this work reveals social and regional dynamics within the Egyptian Empire and explores how linguistic variations correlate with historical and geographical data.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Madùwwe : Collecting Egyptian Words</strong>  
                    <p>This project involves the creation of a comprehensive, open-access etymological databases for Egyptian and Coptic. The database is a foundational resource for researchers studying Afro-Asiatic languages, supported by advanced computational tools for analyzing phonological and morphological changes. <a href="https://github.com/MKilani/Maduwwe" target="_blank">Explore the database</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Beyond the Griffin Warrior</strong>  
                    <p>Since 2021 I have been collaboration with the archeologists of the University of Cincinnati to contextualize and explore the significance of the Levantine finds from their excavations in Pylos. We are now finalizing a first publication of our find so... stay tuned!</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Collaborations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Afro-Asiatic Linguistics Network</strong>  
                    <p>I co-organize workshops and collaborative research initiatives with leading scholars in Berber, Semitic, and Cushitic studies. These collaborations aim to advance comparative Afro-Asiatic linguistics, with an emphasis on sociolinguistic and phonological research that spans several African and Middle Eastern languages.</p>
                    <p>In Fall 2024 we have launched a dedicated <a href="https://afroasiaticcorner.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Blog of Afro-Asiatic linguistics</a>, where we aim to develop in an oepn venues were scholars can discuss the most recent trends in the field.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Computational Tools Development</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python Libraries for Egyptian and Coptic Linguistics</strong>  
                    <p>I have created and published Python libraries to handle Egyptian and Coptic linguistic data, which are available to the academic community on <a href="https://github.com/MKilani" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. These tools facilitate linguistic analysis, allowing researchers to manage complex linguistic datasets with greater accuracy and ease.</p>
