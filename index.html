            <h2>Welcome to My Academic Website</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Marwan Kilani, a scholar at the intersection of linguistics and Egyptology, with a focus on **historical sociolinguistics** and the rich cultural and linguistic interactions of Egypt with its neighbouring regions.</p>

            <p>I have always been fascinated by how societies and people interact and influence eachother, while I've been in love with the Ancient Egyptian language since I was a child.</p>
            <p>My career reflects this two passions, and bridges two primary fields: **linguistics**, particularly comparative Afro-Asiatic studies and Ancient Egyptian, and **Egyptology/archaeology**, where I focus on socio-cultural dynamics and ancient interactions, particularly between Egypt and the Levant. Through historical sociolinguistics, I aim to integrate these perspectives to uncover how ancient languages and cultures interacted, evolved, and influenced each other.</p>

            <p>In addition to my research, I am actively involved in interdisciplinary projects and collaborations that leverage computational tools, database creation, and collaborative networks across linguistic and archaeological domains. I am also dedicated to teaching, promoting a learning environment that emphasizes critical thinking and interdisciplinary exploration.</p>
