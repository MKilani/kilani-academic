            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My research explores both linguistic and Egyptological perspectives, integrating historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and archaeology to reveal how languages and cultures interacted in the ancient world. At the heart of my work is an interest in **linguistic and cultural contacts** and how they shape linguistic evolution and identity in ancient societies.</p>

            <h3>Linguistic Research: Afro-Asiatic & Ancient Egyptian</h3>
            <p>In the field of linguistics, I focus on comparative Afro-Asiatic studies and the historical development of Ancient Egyptian. My work addresses the complexities of reconstructing pre-Coptic Egyptian, exploring dialectal variation, phonological shifts, and Afro-Asiatic connections. This research includes developing computational tools and databases to organize and analyze linguistic data.</p>

            <h3>Egyptology & Archaeology: Understanding Socio-Cultural Dynamics</h3>
            <p>On the Egyptological side, I study ancient Egyptian society, examining archaeological and textual evidence to understand social structures and cross-cultural exchanges, especially between Egypt and the Levant. My interdisciplinary approach allows me to explore questions about trade, diplomacy, and the social impact of language in ancient empires.</p>

            <h3>Historical Sociolinguistics: Bridging Linguistics and Cultural Studies</h3>
            <p>Historical sociolinguistics is the cornerstone that links these two research areas. By using this framework, I aim to connect linguistic data with social, historical, and archaeological insights, revealing how language served as both a product and an instrument of cultural interaction. This approach helps shed light on immaterial dynamics, such as collective identities and power relations within ancient societies.</p>
